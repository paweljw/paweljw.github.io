I'm studying Vue.js right now - here's a simple app that I made in the process.

It's a very simple app - just a couple conditionals glued together with simple data watching. You can play with it at [paweljw.github.io/monster_hunter](/monster_hunter) and check out the (pretty self-explanatory) source code in [paweljw/nice-vue](https://github.com/paweljw/nice-vue/tree/master/monster_hunter). 

The app idea is a part of [Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller at Udemy.
