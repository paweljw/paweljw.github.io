Quick thing I threw together in about an hour: an IoT temperature and humidity meter!

<!--more-->

I've very recently sourced an Omega2+ WiFi board from [Onion](https://onion.io). I've previously only played with Arduino (skipped Raspberry Pi completely), so grabbing something that runs actual Linux on a hefty .5GHz was a whole new world for me.

While rummaging through my electronics supplies (which are in much more disarray that I remember leaving them - that's interesting) I've found this DHT11 brick-form module from, well - the board was made by Xinda probably, and the sensor pack itself by Aosong. Suffice it to say it's extremely chinese in it's quality.

After a couple of soldering misadventures, I managed to get this going (thumbs up for botched soldering jobs!)

It's interesting to note that this board has only three pins instead of the four traditional for DHT bricks. Also the order feels weird to me (left-to-right it's data, Vcc and GND; Vcc, data, GND would make more sense IMHO).

I'm running the Omega2 through their [Power Dock](https://onion.io/store/power-dock/), which - aside from breaking out a bunch of the pins into a header - can both power the board through microUSB (it has a regulator), and it serves as a charge/discharge circuit for a 3.7V LiPo battery.

I've realized, somewhat belatedly, that I did have a battery, and the right connector for the board, but that the battery itself has the wrong connector! It's a JST-BEC connector, where the dock just has a regular 2mm raster connection.

Some last-minute jury rigging (thumbs up for not having the right size thermal shrink!) and here we go:

And here's everything connected together:

I'm using the `dht-sensor` program (I'll probably create my own version for study purposes, but I was pressed for time). Once everything is attached how it should be, it's just a matter of `dht-sensor PIN-NUMBER PROTOCOL-VERSION`:

``` bash
root@Omega-ABCD:~# dht-sensor 3 DHT11
humidity: 58.000000
temperature: 20.000000
```

What's interesting is it can output JSON, though I'm not using this currently. Maybe at a later stage.

``` bash
root@Omega-ABCD:~# dht-sensor 3 DHT11 json
{"humidity": 58.000000, "temperature": 20.000000}
```

Since this is an IoT device, it would not be complete without spilling sensitive information onto the internet. I've decided to use [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com) for the purpose of collecting and graphing that information until I have something useful to do with it.

Another place you can tell from that this is a hurried weekend plaything is this script I'm using for reporting:

``` sh
#!/bin/sh -e

res=`dht-sensor 3 DHT11`
hum=`echo $res | awk '{print $2}'`
temp=`echo $res | awk '{print $4}'`

curl --insecure https://api.thingspeak.com/update \
    --data "api_key=GETYOUROWN" \
    --data "field1=$temp" \
    --data "field2=$hum"

echo oneshot > /sys/class/leds/omega2p\:amber\:system/trigger
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/omega2p\:amber\:system/shot
```

Interesting sidenote - the last two lines allow me to blink the on-board led when the data has been collected and sent.

And that's it for now! We're returning to our regularly-scheduled Vue.js programming soon, probably towards the end of next week. ðŸ˜‰
